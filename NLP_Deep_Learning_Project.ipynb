    "As our dataset is multi label, simply looking at the ditribution of genres is not sufficient. It might be beneficial to see which genres co-occur, as it might shed some light on inherent biases in our dataset. For example, it would make sense if romance and comedy occur together more often than documentary and comedy. Such inherent biases tell us that the underlying population we are sampling from itself is skewed and not balanced. We may then take steps to account for such problems. Even if we don't take such steps, it is important to be aware that we are making the assumption that an unbalanced dataset is not hurting our performance and if need be, we can come back to address this assumption. Good old scientific method, eh?\n",

So, we first define a function which takes a list and makes all possible pairs from it. Then, we pull the list of genres for a movie and run this function on the list of genres to get all pairs of genres which occur together"

One way computer scientists working with natural language tackled this problem in the past (and it is still used very popularly) is what we call TF-IDF i.e. Term Frequence, Inverse Document Frequency. The basic idea here is that words that are strongly indicative of the content of a single document (every movie overview is a document in our case) are words that occur very frequently in that document, and very infrequently in all other documents. For example, \"Computer\" occurs twice here but probably will not in most other movie overviews. Hence, it is indicative. On the other hand, generic words like \"a\",\"and\",\"the\" will occur very often in all documents. Hence, they are not indicative. \n",

The reason for them not working in high dimensions is very strongly linked to what we discussed earlier - having a representative dataset. Consider this, you have a function $f$ dependent only one dependent variable $x$, and $x$ can only integer values from 1 to 100. Since it's one dimensional, it can be plotted on a line. To get a representative sample, you'd need to sample something like - $f(1),f(20),f(40),f(60),f(80),f(100)$"

The interesting bit is that instead of 100 possible values of dependent variables like before, we now have 100,000 possible values! Basically, we can make 100x100 table of possible values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. Wow, that increased exponentially. Not just figuratively, but mathematically exponentially.

For example, if you want to guess my music preferences and you try to train a super awesome model while giving it what my height is as input features, you're going to have no luck. On the other hand, giving it my Spotify playlist will solve the problem with any model. So, CONTEXT of the problem plays a role. \n",

Meaning, if you didn't have access to my Spotify playlist, but to my Facebook statuses - You know all my statuses about Harvard may not be useful. But if you represent me as my Facebook statuses which are YouTube links, that would also solve the problem. So, AVAILABILITY OF DATA at hand is the second factor. \n",

If you have many independent features that each correlate well with the class, learning is easy. On the other hand, if the class is a very complex function of the features, you may not be able to learn it.\n",

In the next layer, it learns that if you combine the vectors representing vertical and horizontal vectors in different ratios, you can make all possible slanted lines. Next layer learns to combine lines to form curves - Say, something like the outline of a face. These curves come together to form 3D objects. And so on.

    "Once again, we must make an implementation decision. This time, it has more to do with how much time are we willing to spend in return for added accuracy. We are going to use here a technique that is commonly referred to as Pre-Training in Machine Learning Literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of me trying to re-invent the wheel here, I am going to borrow this short section on pre-training from Stanford University's lecture on <a href='http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/'> CNN's</a>. To quote - \n",
    "\n",
    "''In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest. ''\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three broad ways in which transfer learning or pre-training can be done. (The 2 concepts are different and to understand the difference clearly, I suggest you read the linked lecture thoroughly). The way we are going to about it is by using a pre-trained, released ConvNet as feature extractor. Take a ConvNet pretrained on ImageNet (a popular object detection dataset), remove the last fully-connected layer. After removing the last layer, what we have is just another neural network i.e. a stack of space tranformations. But, originally the output of this stack can be pumped into a single layer which can classify the image into categories like Car, Dog, Cat and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means, is that in the space this stack transforms the images to, all images which contain a \"dog\" are closer to each other, and all images containing a \"cat\" are closer. Thus, it is a meaningful space where images with similar objects are closer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it, now if we pump our posters through this stack, it will embed them in a space where posters which contain similar objects are closer. This is a very meaningful feature engineering method! While this may not be ideal for genre prediction, it might be quite meaningful. For example, all posters with a gun or a car are probably action. While a smiling couple would point to romance or drama. The alternative would be to train the CNN from scratch which is fairly computationally intensive and involves a lot of tricks to get the CNN training to converge to the optimal space tranformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we can start off with something strong, and then build on top. We pump our images through the pre-trained network to extract the visual features from the posters. Then, using these features as descriptors for the image, and genres as the labels, we train a simpler neural network from scratch which learns to do simply classification on this dataset. These 2 steps are exactly what we are going to do for predicting genres from movie posters."

This is called the VGG-net. Or as they call it, we will extract the VGG features of an image. Mathematically, as mentioned, it's just a space transformation in the form of layers. So, we simply need to perform this chain of transformations on our image, right? Keras is a library that makes it very easy for us to do this. Some other common ones are Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Numpy arrays when created, a fixed size is allocated in the memory and when we stack, a new one is copied and created in a new location. This makes the code really, really slow. The best way to do it (and this remains the same with MATLAB matrices if you work with them), is to create a numpy array of zeros, and over-write it row by row.

    "Don’t forget what the original premise of machine learning (and thus deep learning) is - IF the input and output are related by a function y=f(x), then if we have x, there is no way to exactly know f unless we know the process itself. However, machine learning gives you the ability to approximate f with a function g, and the process of trying out multiple candidates to identify the function g best approximating f is called machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, that was machine learning, and how is deep learning different? Deep learning simply tries to expand the possible kind of functions that can be approximated using the above mentioned machine learning paradigm. Roughly speaking, if the previous model could learn say 10,000 kinds of functions, now it will be able to learn say 100,000 kinds (in actuality both are infinite spaces but one is larger than the other, because maths is cool that ways.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know the mathematics of it, go read about VC dimension and how more layers in a network affect it. But I will avoid the mathematics here and rely on your intuition to believe me when I say that not all data can be classified correctly into categories using a linear function. So, we need our deep learning model to be able to approximate more complex functions than just a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s come to your non linearity bit. Imagine a linear function y=2x+3, and another one y=4x+7. What happens if I pool them and take an average? I get another linear function y= 3x+5. So instead of doing those two computations separately and then averaging it out, I could have just used the single linear function y=3x+5. Obviously, this logic holds good if I have more than 2 such linear functions. This is exactly what will happen if you don’t have have non-linearities in your nodes, and also what others have written in their answers.\n",

    "In a nutshell, you’ll only be trying to learn a linear approximation for original function f relating the input and the output. Which as we discussed above, is not always the best approximation. Adding non-linearities ensures that you can learn more complex functions by approximating every non-linear function as a LINEAR combination of a large number of non-linear functions.\n",

More data is the first thing you should try if you want better results. Then, you can start playing with training on GPUs, learning rate schedules and other hyperparameters. Finally, you can consider using ResNet, a much more powerful neural network model than VGG. All of these can be tried once you have a working knowledge of machine learning."

    "Congrats! This is the end of our pilot project! Needless to say, a lot of the above content may be new to you, or may be things that you know very well. If it's the former, I hope this tutorial would have helped you. If it is the latter and you think I wrote something incorrect or that my understanding can be improved, feel free to create a github issue so that I can correct it! \n",

    "Writing tutorials can take a lot of time, but it is a great learning experience. I am currently working on a tutorial focussing on word embeddings, which will explore word2vec and other word embeddings in detail. While it will take some time to be up, I will post a link to it's repository on the README for this project so that interested readers can find it.\n",

    "I would like to thank a few of my friends who had an indispensible role to play in me making this tutorial. Firstly, Professor Hanspeter Pfister and Verena Kaynig at Harvard, who helped guide this tutorial/project and scope it. Secondly, my friends Sahil Loomba and Matthew Tancik for their suggestions and editing the material and the presentation of the storyline. Thirdly, Zoya Bylinskii at MIT for constantly motivating me to put in my effort into this tutorial. Finally, all others who helped me feel confident enough to take up this task and to see it till the end. Thanks all of you!"
